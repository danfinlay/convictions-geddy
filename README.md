#Convictions#
##Because the right action stays right until it's done.##
###Contesting the goldfish-attention-span of the internet.###

Convictions aims to allow groups of any size to debate issues of any variety, with a unique debate interface that allows persistent, democratic representation of the various points for and against every issue, and even every point.

An early proof-of-concept of the vision was written in Python, and can be seen [on Google's App Engine](http://my-convictions.appspot.com/), and can be found on github [here](https://github.com/flyswatter/convictions).
